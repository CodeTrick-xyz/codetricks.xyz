## Problem Statement
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        profits = []
        item = prices[0]
        for i in range(len(prices)):
            gain = prices[i] - item
            item = min(item, prices[i])
            profits.append(gain)

        return max(profits)
```
