## Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** array of integers nums of length `n`. You are initially positioned at `nums[0]`.

Each element `nums[i]` represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i. In other words, if you are at `nums[i]`, you can jump to any `nums[i + j]` where:

    `0 <= j <= nums[i]` and <br />
    `i + j < n`

Return the minimum number of jumps to reach nums[n - 1]. The test cases are generated such that you can reach nums[n - 1].

## Solution
```py
class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        currEndJump = 0
        maxEndJump = 0
        jumps = 0
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
            maxEndJump = max(maxEndJump, i + nums[i])

            if maxEndJump >= len(nums) - 1:
                jumps += 1
                break
            
            if i == currEndJump:
                jumps += 1
                currEndJump = maxEndJump
        
        return jumps
```
