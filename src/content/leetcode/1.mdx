## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

## Solution
```py
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        hm = {}

        for i, n in enumerate(nums):
            diff = target - n
            if diff in hm:
                return [hm[diff], i]
            hm[n] = i
```
