### Introduction

Rust is a general-purpose programming language that emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency. It enforces memory safety, meaning that all references point to valid memory without a garbage collector.

Rust was created as a personal project by Graydon Hoare while working at Mozilla Research in 2006. Today, Rust is adopted by many companies, including Amazon, Discord, Dropbox, Google, and Microsoft.

According to [Stack Overflow’s developer survey](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/01/20/what-is-rust-and-why-is-it-so-popular/), 97% of the survey respondents have not used the Rust programming language. So by the end of this article, you will join the 3% who have worked with the Rust programming language.

Let’s begin our Rust journey.

### Why Rust?

Before learning Rust, you may wonder why you should learn the Rust programming language when there are similar languages like C and C++.

Let’s explore why it has become a favored language among developers:

1. **Performance:** Rust is as fast as C and C++, making it ideal for system-level programming.
2. **Memory Safety:** Rust prevents null pointer dereferencing and buffer overflows through its ownership system.
3. **Concurrency:** Rust’s concurrency model ensures that data races are caught at compile-time.
4. **Ecosystem and Tooling:** Cargo, Rust’s package manager and build system, simplifies dependency management and project configuration.
5. **Community:** Rust has a vibrant and welcoming community, with great documentation and support.

### Installation

#### Linux or MacOS Installation

To install the Rust programming language on your Linux or MacOS machine, run the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

After the installation finishes, run the following commands to verify if Rust is installed properly:

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

If you don’t have curl installed on your machine, run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install curl
```

#### Windows Installation

To install the Rust programming language on a Windows system, follow these steps:

- First, go to the [Rust official page](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and download the installer for Windows.
- After the installation finishes, run the following commands to check if Rust is installed properly:

    ```bash
    rustc --version
    cargo --version
    ```

### Your First Rust Program: Hello World

Let’s write the classic “Hello, World!” program to get a feel of Rust’s syntax and structure.

1. Create a new Rust project:
    
    ```bash
    cargo new hello_world
    cd hello_world
    ```
    
2. Navigate to the src directory and open `main.rs`:
    
    ```bash
    cd src
    vim main.rs
    ```
    
    Feel free to open the Rust project in your preferred IDE.
    
3. Edit `main.rs` to print “Hello, World!”:
    
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        println!("Hello, World!");
    }
    ```
    
4. Build and run the program:
    
    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```
    
    This step does the job of both compilation and running, so you don’t need to compile the program manually every time you run it.

#### Understanding the Code

- `fn main() { ... }`: This defines the main function, which serves as the entry point of a Rust program.
- `println!`: It is a macro in Rust used for printing to the console.

So, this was your first Rust program. How do you feel?

### Conclusion

Rust combines the performance and control of low-level languages with modern programming paradigms, making it a powerful tool for developers. From its unique ownership model to its robust ecosystem, Rust offers a rich programming experience.

Here are a few important shell commands we have discussed:

- **Create a new project**: `cargo new project_name`
- **Build a project**: `cargo build`
- **Run a project**: `cargo run`

So, this was it for this article. Stay tuned!

Happy coding in Rust!
